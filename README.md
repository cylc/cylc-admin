# Cylc Project Admin

A repository for [Cylc Workflow Engine](https://github.com/cylc/cylc) project
documents that don't belong with the source code (such as meeting agendas) or
or which inhabit a grey zone between initial planning/discussion and inclusion
in the official project documentation.

Markdown documents in `docs/` are automatically published to GitHub Pages (see
the URL in the repository description).
